# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code when working in this repository.

## What this is

**Archetype** — a browser-based workspace for writing and maintaining a long narrative, with an
AI agent that assists rather than authors. A rich-text manuscript editor sits in the center; an
outline panel (table of contents, narrative timeline, character interaction chart, story bible)
sits on one side; an agentic AI chat panel sits on the other. The writer selects text and asks
questions about it; the agent reads the manuscript, maintains a structured story bible, checks
continuity, and reports findings.

React + TypeScript frontend, Python (FastAPI) backend, one SQLite file per project holding
relational data plus keyword and vector indexes. Single user, localhost, Windows 11 primary.

Python package: `archetype`. Config/env namespace: `ARCHETYPE_`. The repository directory is
`WritingAssistant` — a path, not the product name.

**Current state: Phase 1 in progress — Group A (P1-1 → P1-4) complete.** All twenty decisions are
resolved and binding. What exists: the two-sided scaffold, configuration and the secret guard,
the project file schema with its migration runner, the ID generator, and the project store. The
frontend is a placeholder that confirms the toolchain — no editor, no API routes beyond
`/api/health`, no AI. Next: Group B (P1-5 → P1-8), the REST routes, the save protocol, and the
text projection.

## The specs are the contract

- [specs/project-outline.md](specs/project-outline.md) — the root document: vision, architecture,
  phase list, testing strategy, risks. **Read this first.**
- [specs/development-phases.md](specs/development-phases.md) — the **authoritative decision
  register** (D1–D20) and the work breakdown across all phases. Cite these IDs.
- [specs/phase-1-plan.md](specs/phase-1-plan.md) — Phase 1 work items (`P1-1` … `P1-15`), exit
  criteria, and the as-built deviations table.
- [specs/backlog.md](specs/backlog.md) — deferred features and open questions (`Q1`–`Q6`), each
  with the phase it must be settled by.
- `specs/data-model.md`, `specs/api-contract.md`, `specs/anchors.md`, `specs/agent-tools.md` —
  written as their phases begin (data-model and api-contract land in Phase 1, item `P1-15`).

Work items carry stable IDs (`P3-4`) that commits and code comments reference. IDs are never
renumbered — a dropped item is marked **withdrawn**, not deleted.

## Rules

### Keep the documents current

- **Any change to scope, architecture, phase boundaries, the data model, or a `D<n>` decision is
  recorded in `specs/project-outline.md` first**, then in the decision register, then in the
  affected phase plan, then here. Bump the version and date in a spec's header on every
  substantive edit.
- **Phase plans record as-built deviations.** When the code has to diverge from the plan, write
  down what actually happened and why — in that phase plan's deviations table, in the same
  change. A spec that describes something the code no longer does is a bug.
- **This file must describe the project as it currently is, never as it was planned.** When a
  phase completes, a dependency is added, a command changes, or an invariant is established,
  update `CLAUDE.md` in the same change.

### Testing

- Every phase adds tests. The suite must be green at every phase boundary, and a work item is
  not done without them.
- **A failing test is fixed before any other work continues — including a test the current work
  "shouldn't have touched."** Unrelated is a hypothesis, not an excuse; a failure means an
  assumption broke somewhere.
- **Never delete, skip, or loosen a test to get a green suite.** If a test genuinely asserts the
  wrong thing, fixing it is a deliberate change: correct the test and record what changed and
  why in the current phase plan.
- Unit tests never touch the network, a real LLM, or a real API key. A `FakeProvider` and
  `FakeEmbedder` back the backend suite; the frontend tests against a hand-written fake API
  client. Tests that require a live provider are marked `@pytest.mark.live` and excluded by
  default.
- Contract fixtures are shared JSON: the backend writes them, the frontend type-checks against
  them, so a wire-shape change fails the suite rather than the browser.
- AI *output quality* is not automatically tested in 1.0 — it is assessed by hand against
  scripted scenarios recorded in the phase plan.

### Design invariants

- **The writer owns the words.** The agent never mutates manuscript text or accepted bible
  records directly. It emits proposals and findings the user accepts, edits, or rejects, and a
  proposed text edit always shows an explicit before/after (D5, D12).
- **Every AI feature has a manual path first**, and the agent drives the same API the UI does.
- **No AI call outside the provider port.** No provider SDK is imported outside `llm/adapters/`;
  nothing above the port knows which provider is in play.
- **The agent never receives the whole manuscript.** Context is composed from an explicit
  selection, requested ranges, retrieval results, and bible entries, within token budgets, and
  the composed context is recorded on the run record.
- **Token spend is always a deliberate user act** (D13). No background AI work in 1.0.
- **Anchors are load-bearing.** A stored text reference keeps its quote plus surrounding context
  and is re-verified on load; an unresolvable anchor becomes `stale` and is surfaced, never
  silently re-pointed at the wrong passage.
- **The server owns the authoritative text projection** — `text_plain`, word count, and headings
  are derived server-side on save (D18). The client may mirror it for liveness, but the server
  answer wins.
- **Secrets are server-side only** (D8). API keys come from the environment, are never returned
  by any route, and never reach the browser or Git.
- **Wire and storage schemas are extension-only.** Add fields; never repurpose or remove one
  without a migration and a note in the phase plan. Migrations are numbered and forward-only,
  each shipping with a test that runs it against a fixture database from the previous version
  (D20).
- Keep the dependency surface small — every package must earn its place. No CSS framework, no
  component library, no state library (D10), no ORM.
- IDs are prefixed short tokens (`prj_`, `doc_`, `anc_`, `ent_`, `run_`); timestamps are UTC
  ISO-8601 everywhere, formatted only at the display edge.

## Commands

Real as of Group A. `P1-15` finalises this section at phase close — the single-process run mode
(`P1-14`) is not built yet.

```powershell
# bootstrap (once)
cd server; python -m venv .venv; .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
cd web; npm install

# run — two processes, two terminals
cd server; .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m archetype     # API on 127.0.0.1:8787
cd web; npm run dev                                    # app on 127.0.0.1:5173, /api proxied

# test and lint
cd server; .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest
cd server; .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m ruff check .; .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m ruff format .
cd web; npm test; npm run typecheck; npm run build
```

Built and tested on Python 3.14 and Node 24; the declared floors are 3.11 and 20.

Settings layer defaults < `config.yaml` < `ARCHETYPE_*` env vars, env winning. Keys are
documented in the README; `ARCHETYPE_CONFIG_FILE` relocates the YAML layer, which is how the
suite keeps a developer's real config out of its way.

## Where things live

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `server/archetype/config.py` | Settings layering and the `SecretStr` guard (`P1-2`, D8) |
| `server/archetype/ids.py` | Prefixed short-token IDs and `random_token` (`P1-3`) |
| `server/archetype/projects/db.py` | Connections, pragmas, explicit transactions, `utc_now` |
| `server/archetype/projects/migrations.py` | The forward-only migration runner (D20) |
| `server/archetype/projects/migrations/*.sql` | Numbered schema migrations |
| `server/archetype/projects/store.py` | `ProjectStore`, `ProjectHandle`, the directory scan (D17) |
| `server/archetype/app.py` | `create_app()`; routes proper arrive in `P1-5` |
| `server/tests/fixtures/db/` | Databases captured at a known schema version, with their README |
| `web/src/` | The Vite + React 18 client |

**Invariants established in Group A**, beyond those already listed above:

- **Transaction control is explicit.** Connections open with `isolation_level=None`; `BEGIN` and
  `COMMIT` are written, never implied. A migration carries its transaction *inside* the script
  text, because `executescript` commits whatever transaction is already open.
- **Looking at a project never changes it.** The directory scan opens files read-only; migrations
  run only on an explicit open.
- **A bad file in the projects directory is reported, not fatal.** `scan()` returns readable
  projects alongside skipped ones with a reason.
- **Secrets are unwritable, not just untested.** A `SecretStr` settings field that is not declared
  `Field(exclude=True)` raises at class-definition time, and the YAML layer refuses to supply one.
