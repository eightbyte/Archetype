# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code when working in this repository.

## What this is

**Archetype** — a browser-based workspace for writing and maintaining a long narrative, with an
AI agent that assists rather than authors. A rich-text manuscript editor sits in the center; an
outline panel (table of contents, narrative timeline, character interaction chart, story bible)
sits on one side; an agentic AI chat panel sits on the other. The writer selects text and asks
questions about it; the agent reads the manuscript, maintains a structured story bible, checks
continuity, and reports findings.

React + TypeScript frontend, Python (FastAPI) backend, one SQLite file per project holding
relational data plus keyword and vector indexes. Single user, localhost, Windows 11 primary.

Python package: `archetype`. Config/env namespace: `ARCHETYPE_`. The repository directory is
`WritingAssistant` — a path, not the product name.

**Current state: Phase 0 complete.** All sixteen decisions are resolved and binding; the Phase 1
plan is written and awaiting approval. **No code exists yet** — the specs are the only artifact.

## The specs are the contract

- [specs/project-outline.md](specs/project-outline.md) — the root document: vision, architecture,
  phase list, testing strategy, risks. **Read this first.**
- [specs/development-phases.md](specs/development-phases.md) — the **authoritative decision
  register** (D1–D20) and the work breakdown across all phases. Cite these IDs.
- [specs/phase-1-plan.md](specs/phase-1-plan.md) — Phase 1 work items (`P1-1` … `P1-15`), exit
  criteria, and the as-built deviations table.
- [specs/backlog.md](specs/backlog.md) — deferred features and open questions (`Q1`–`Q6`), each
  with the phase it must be settled by.
- `specs/data-model.md`, `specs/api-contract.md`, `specs/anchors.md`, `specs/agent-tools.md` —
  written as their phases begin (data-model and api-contract land in Phase 1, item `P1-15`).

Work items carry stable IDs (`P3-4`) that commits and code comments reference. IDs are never
renumbered — a dropped item is marked **withdrawn**, not deleted.

## Rules

### Keep the documents current

- **Any change to scope, architecture, phase boundaries, the data model, or a `D<n>` decision is
  recorded in `specs/project-outline.md` first**, then in the decision register, then in the
  affected phase plan, then here. Bump the version and date in a spec's header on every
  substantive edit.
- **Phase plans record as-built deviations.** When the code has to diverge from the plan, write
  down what actually happened and why — in that phase plan's deviations table, in the same
  change. A spec that describes something the code no longer does is a bug.
- **This file must describe the project as it currently is, never as it was planned.** When a
  phase completes, a dependency is added, a command changes, or an invariant is established,
  update `CLAUDE.md` in the same change.

### Testing

- Every phase adds tests. The suite must be green at every phase boundary, and a work item is
  not done without them.
- **A failing test is fixed before any other work continues — including a test the current work
  "shouldn't have touched."** Unrelated is a hypothesis, not an excuse; a failure means an
  assumption broke somewhere.
- **Never delete, skip, or loosen a test to get a green suite.** If a test genuinely asserts the
  wrong thing, fixing it is a deliberate change: correct the test and record what changed and
  why in the current phase plan.
- Unit tests never touch the network, a real LLM, or a real API key. A `FakeProvider` and
  `FakeEmbedder` back the backend suite; the frontend tests against a hand-written fake API
  client. Tests that require a live provider are marked `@pytest.mark.live` and excluded by
  default.
- Contract fixtures are shared JSON: the backend writes them, the frontend type-checks against
  them, so a wire-shape change fails the suite rather than the browser.
- AI *output quality* is not automatically tested in 1.0 — it is assessed by hand against
  scripted scenarios recorded in the phase plan.

### Design invariants

- **The writer owns the words.** The agent never mutates manuscript text or accepted bible
  records directly. It emits proposals and findings the user accepts, edits, or rejects, and a
  proposed text edit always shows an explicit before/after (D5, D12).
- **Every AI feature has a manual path first**, and the agent drives the same API the UI does.
- **No AI call outside the provider port.** No provider SDK is imported outside `llm/adapters/`;
  nothing above the port knows which provider is in play.
- **The agent never receives the whole manuscript.** Context is composed from an explicit
  selection, requested ranges, retrieval results, and bible entries, within token budgets, and
  the composed context is recorded on the run record.
- **Token spend is always a deliberate user act** (D13). No background AI work in 1.0.
- **Anchors are load-bearing.** A stored text reference keeps its quote plus surrounding context
  and is re-verified on load; an unresolvable anchor becomes `stale` and is surfaced, never
  silently re-pointed at the wrong passage.
- **The server owns the authoritative text projection** — `text_plain`, word count, and headings
  are derived server-side on save (D18). The client may mirror it for liveness, but the server
  answer wins.
- **Secrets are server-side only** (D8). API keys come from the environment, are never returned
  by any route, and never reach the browser or Git.
- **Wire and storage schemas are extension-only.** Add fields; never repurpose or remove one
  without a migration and a note in the phase plan. Migrations are numbered and forward-only,
  each shipping with a test that runs it against a fixture database from the previous version
  (D20).
- Keep the dependency surface small — every package must earn its place. No CSS framework, no
  component library, no state library (D10), no ORM.
- IDs are prefixed short tokens (`prj_`, `doc_`, `anc_`, `ent_`, `run_`); timestamps are UTC
  ISO-8601 everywhere, formatted only at the display edge.

## Commands

**None yet — scaffolding lands in Phase 1 (`P1-1`).** This section must be filled in with the
real bootstrap, run, test, and lint commands as part of `P1-15`, before Phase 1 can close.

Planned shape (not yet real): server on `127.0.0.1:8787` via uvicorn, web dev server via Vite
with `/api` proxied, `pytest` in `server/`, `vitest` in `web/`, `ruff` for Python lint.
